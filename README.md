# Druids.me 🌳✨

**Pioneering the next evolution of the Internet.**  
We are building **The Authentication Project** — essential, secure, and unstoppable.  
Join us and **govern the future**. 🌐🚀

---

## 🔮 Vision
At Druids.me, we believe the next generation of the Internet must be:
- **Community-governed** — power in the hands of people, not corporations.  
- **Secure by design** — authentication that cannot be compromised.  
- **Unstoppable** — resilient to censorship, takedowns, or single points of failure.  

Our goal is to make trust and identity on the web **as natural as breathing**.

## 🛠 What We’re Building
- **The Authentication Project** — a foundation for decentralized identity and trust.  
- **Community governance** — decisions guided by those who build and use it.  
- **Source-available code** — learn, discuss, and contribute (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md)).
