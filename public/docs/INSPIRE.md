## CEO

Hi, my name is **Tomek Grzechowski**.

When I was 14, I sold my first piece of software - a program written in Pascal with both text and graphical UI. It helped electrical engineers double-check calculations and drawings, and it remained in use for more than 15 years.

Since then, I’ve been building software for people who needed my help to achieve their goals - for nearly 30 years now.

## 2006

This story begins in 2006, when I sat down with my friend Przemek, an economist, and shared a simple vision: a path toward world peace through a new kind of governance, built on a new kind of technology. It was the idea of online money — a currency that could not be owned by any existing country or organization. In fact, it required the creation of an entirely new form of organization.

I made it clear that I was not interested in building the online currency technology myself — I was already deeply engaged in other work. However, I said that once such a technology became available, I would present a solution designed to bring humankind together and, ultimately, lead to world peace.

It was autumn/winter 2006, 25-28 months before first publication of Bitcoin.

## Preparations

I am an intuitive person — a kind of translator of the heart — who keeps searching until a solution or vision emerges. I have spent countless nights analyzing ideas and patterns beyond conventional thinking, exploring what others might dismiss as unusual, to better understand the hidden forces that shape our world.

I have explored religions, psychology, sociology, business, as well as emerging frameworks and methodologies of communication and management — all in search of ways to design new kinds of software that could enable us to manage the world globally, from a single shared platform.

Most importantly, I have studied the roots of war and conflict — how different wills, interests, and circumstances converge into violence — to better understand what kind of global system would be required to stop it.

In the process, I envisioned a new banking and economic model aimed at eliminating one of humanity’s oldest problems: inflation.

But such projects cannot be realized through the slow, fragmented evolution of individual countries or kingdoms. They require us to rise above these divisions and embrace a new, united approach to global communication.

Such solutions require trust, truth, and transparency — and none of these can exist without a global system of authentication.

That is why I am proposing this project: Druids.Me (codename).

**I hope you will see the value in this vision and choose to help me build it.**

Sincerely yours,
*Tomek Grzechowski*
