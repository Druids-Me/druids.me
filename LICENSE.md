## 7. Community Protection Against Scams

We have seen many **scammers copying the codes of websites** and attempting to scam people out of money. This LICENSE is prepared to protect the community against such abuse.  

Such acts are a **serious violation of this License** and may be considered **fraud, copyright infringement, and criminal activity**.  

The Druids.Me project has a strong and active community. Offenders should know:  
- The community may actively report and pursue violators,  
- These acts are punishable by law, and  
- Legal action may be taken with full damages sought.  

The **value of the code alone is not the measure** of this project. The true value lies in the entire community, its media, text, spirit, and identity — which this License exists to protect.

## 8. Enforcement and Remedies

8.1 **Termination.** This License automatically terminates if you breach any term. Upon termination you must immediately stop using the Software and destroy all copies in your possession or control. Your past breaches survive termination.

8.2 **Injunctive Relief and Damages.** Unpermitted **Public Deployment** or **Commercial Use** causes immediate and irreparable harm. In addition to any other remedies, Licensor may seek injunctive relief, actual damages, statutory damages (where available), disgorgement of profits, and recovery of its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

8.3 **Liquidated Damages.** The parties agree—**to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law**—that each instance of unpermitted **Public Deployment** or **Commercial Use**, including publishing a clone or substantially similar website or service based on the Software, will result in **liquidated damages of USD $1,000,000,000 (one billion U.S. dollars)** per breach. If a court finds this clause unenforceable as a penalty, it shall be severed and Licensor may pursue all other remedies and the maximum damages allowed by law.

## 10. Governing Law; Venue

This License is governed by the laws of **[choose jurisdiction]**, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. The exclusive venue for any dispute relating to this License or the Software will be the courts located in **[choose city, jurisdiction]**, and you consent to personal jurisdiction there.

---

## 11. Severability; No Waiver; Entire Agreement

If any provision of this License is unenforceable, it will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to be enforceable, and the remainder will remain in effect. Failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver. This License is the entire agreement between you and Licensor concerning the Software and supersedes any prior understandings on this subject.
